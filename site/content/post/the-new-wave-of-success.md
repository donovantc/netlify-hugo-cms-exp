This is my first blog and as I type these words, a million thoughts run through my mind, but it is blank. Blank as when the lights go out in the isolated and abandoned cottage on the hill. You may be wondering what I am talking about, but success follows this path. To get there, and to understand, you will have to open your mind for a minute. Step away from your distractions, take a deep breath and feel the pure air flowing through your body, like a white ghost, only the blurry outlines of which, purify everything in its path, pushing away the scum gathered from years of impurity.

You see, success is a consequence and not an action. However, it requires action, without which the consequence is lost and therefore so is success. Not just any action will suffice, there are several ingredients which together form the perfect blend of mental attitude which will take you down the path of success. This mental attitude guides your actions. It can lead to success or failure. Don't be fooled into thinking that there is no such thing as success or failure. This is what the weak say to comfort themselves. **Success** and **failure** are real but they are as real as they need to be, which is defined by the mental attitude composed of the perfect set of ingredients, which means success and failure are relevant. But if you believe neither exist, it's not relevant, you have failed already.

What are these _ingredients_ you may ask? Please do. But consume this idea first, only then will you be ready to proceed.
